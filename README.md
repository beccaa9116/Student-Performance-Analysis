# ðŸ“Š Student Performance Analysis

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on student performance data to understand the factors that affect students' academic success. By analyzing trends, patterns, and correlations between various attributes like gender, parental education, test scores, and study habits, we aim to uncover actionable insights that can help improve educational outcomes.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- **`student_performance_analysis.ipynb`**: The primary notebook where the entire analysis is conducted, including data cleaning, visualization, and interpretation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

1. Understand key factors influencing student performance.
2. Analyze the relationship between student demographics and test scores.
3. Visualize trends and correlations in the data to reveal insights that can inform educational strategies.
4. Provide recommendations based on findings to improve student outcomes.

## ðŸ“Š Data Sources

The analysis uses publicly available datasets on student performance, which includes attributes such as student gender, parental education levels, test scores, and study habits.
